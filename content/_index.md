              Topic –“Natural and Forced Characteristics of Circular and Electric Jet Diffusion Flames"

              Conducted experimental study on natural and acoustically excited circular and elliptic jet diffusion flames using high-speed schlieren flow visualization. Analyzed flame response through time series data extraction, including Fast Fourier Transform, Spectrogram, and Dynamic Mode Decomposition. Investigated hydrodynamic instability and forcing response of flames, observing various dynamic states such as period-2 oscillations and mode locking. Identified scaling relationship between Strouhal and Froude numbers using minor diameter as characteristic length.

              * Designed and fabricated the flame chamber & experimental setup using Solidworks.
              * Programmed a LabView code to run the  facility, taking into consideration valve operations, camera trigger and acoustic distubance trigger.
              * Developed an image processing based MATLAB code for extraction of dynamic modes of flame from schlieren images and further post processing of the data.
