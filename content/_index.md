              Topic –“Modal Decomposition Analysis of Unsteady Flow Field"

              Conducted a modal decomposition analysis of unsteady flow fields, focusing on the application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) techniques. Analyzed flow dynamics through decomposition of simulation data, extracting dominant modes and investigating their temporal characteristics. Applied a new criterion for DMD mode selection to improve the accuracy of flow field representation.

              * Performed modal decomposition on 2D incompressible flow past circular and side-by-side cylinders using POD and DMD.
              * Analyzed flow response using time-resolved simulation snapshots, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to validate dominant frequencies.
              * Investigated flow dynamics in transient and saturated flow regions, observing phenomena such as vortex shedding and flip-flopping.
              * Developed reduced-order approximations of the flow field using POD to represent complex dynamics with fewer modes. 
              * Implemented a new criterion for DMD mode selection, evaluating its effectiveness in capturing dominant flow structures.
