The Bionic Reader Toggle is a Chrome extension designed to improve reading speed and comprehension by applying the Bionic Reading technique. It bolds the first few letters of each word to guide the eyes and help retain focus while reading online.

The extension adds a toggleable switch in the Chrome toolbar. When activated, it transforms the visible text of the current webpage into Bionic format. When deactivated, it reverts the text back to its original form.

### Where It Works Well
* Static sites (Wikipedia, blogs, news sites)
* Basic dynamic sites with full page reloads
* Sites with mostly readable, text-heavy content

If you'd like to try out Bionic Reading Toggle, you can easily add it to your Chrome browser. The complete code for this extension is available on GitHub link. To install it, simply download the repository, navigate to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner, and then click "Load unpacked." Select the folder containing the extension files, and Bionic Reading extension will be ready to use.
