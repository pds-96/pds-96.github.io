This project explored using Gemini Pro to create a Chrome extension called "Smart Tab Muter." The extension smartly manages audio in your browser tabs. When you switch to a new tab, it mutes any sound playing in other inactive tabs and unmutes the audio in your current tab. If you navigate back to a previously active tab, the extension will again mute all other tabs, allowing the audio in your current tab to continue. If you don't manually unmute the new tab, the audio from the last active tab will keep playing.

If you'd like to try out Smart Tab Muter, you can easily add it to your Chrome browser. The complete code for this extension is available on GitHub link. To install it, simply download the repository, navigate to Chrome's Extensions page (chrome://extensions/), enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner, and then click "Load unpacked." Select the folder containing the extension files, and Smart Tab Muter will be ready to use.
