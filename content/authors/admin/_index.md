TO BE UPDATED - -Hey there, I'm Devvrat, a generalist at the intersection of Business & Technology. I am pursuing a Master's in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the University of Washington and earned my stripes in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology. 
For around 4 years, I worked at the U R Rao Satellite Centre, Indian Space Research Organization, where I've had a blast playing with MATLAB, Simulink, Python, C++ to ensure things fly the way they are intended to. From analyzing spacecraft orbits to creating nifty models, I'm all about pushing the boundaries in aerospace tech and finding smart solutions with a bunch of awesome folks.
