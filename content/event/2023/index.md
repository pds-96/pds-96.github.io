All the books ðŸ“š I read in 2023, up until mid-May when I consciously decided to stop reading for a while. I haven't picked up any books since then this year.

I noticed a narrative fallacy developing due to reading many books about historical events. This led me to form opinions about most things, often correlating current issues with past events, which I realized was a potentially dangerous mindset. My initial aim in reading these books was to broaden my understanding of the world around me, but I became aware of the bias that this habit could introduce. Consequently, I decided to stop reading for the time being and focus more on experiencing and feeling things, rather than being in a position to say 'I knew it.'

I plan to return to reading when it feels right, but I'm not setting any benchmarks for when that will be.

Best book - 'Snow Crash'
