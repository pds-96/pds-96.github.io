13 #Books ðŸ“š  I read in 2024. It wasn't a year focused on reading so I read only what came my way instead of actively searching for titles.

Target for 2025 is to make it 18, seems like an ideal time allocation while focusing on other hobbies/side projects. 

Favourites which I plan to re-read in future
1. A city on Mars
2. Chip War
