27 books in 2022 ðŸ“š

It's that time of the year again. I get excited by the thought of making a collage for the year's consistent efforts, although this year, most of it came during the first half of the year.

Jan to May had the count to 21 books, and the 2nd half barely had anything to add, that too after October end.
A realization is that this habit has its own cycles; a good month amps up the expectations, which leads to shuffling through many books to get the next right one, which doesn't always come along and leads to a drop in expectations, and the cycle continues. The external factor affecting would, of course, be unknown and could only be dealt with discipline and a belief that this too shall pass as it was during June to October.

If it's important enough, you will find time; this was realization no 2 from the hectic MBA schedule over the last 6 months.
With the ever-growing wish list for 2023, I have my important things sorted.

Top books of 2022 for me (In alphabetical order)
1. Gift from the sea
2. Red Roulette
3. Rejection proof
4. Shadow divers
5. The biggest bluff
6. The secret race
7. Ultramarathon man
8. Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance

The best find of the year â€“ Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. It's a difficult book to read, and I had to put this down 2-3 times because it stopped making sense at times, but I kept coming back to it, sometimes after a month. This book changed how I think about activities I do out of passion. Will reread it this year and try to make sense of it again.
