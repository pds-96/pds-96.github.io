36 books in 2021 ðŸ“š

That's it. That's my biggest accomplishment this year. With zero books in dec and a lukewarm november, I had given up on beating 2020 (31 books) until I counted.

I have always been fascinated with book cover collages. I still take screenshot of them whenever I find one on social media and scout for books to read.

To me, this is a thing of beauty.

Although the number of books read is in no way an indication of anything, the effort here is to make this a lifelong habit.

My top books for 2021
1. Into thin Air.
2. Investing for Growth.
3. Romancing the Balance Sheet.
4. American Kingpin.
5. Bulls, Bears and other beasts.
6. Prisoners of Geography.
7. Technical analysis using multiple timeframe.

Already excitedÂ forÂ 2022Â âš¡âš¡
