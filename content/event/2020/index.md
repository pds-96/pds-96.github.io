2020 has been good, bad and ugly, depending on where you are and what you do (statistically).
For me it has been a good year and I am greatful to not end up on the wrong side of 2020. This also gave me enough time to satisfy my reading cravings. I feel fortunate to be able to read 32 books this year.
 
I read 31 books in 2020, here are the best of this year from me (in no particular order).
 
1. Narrative Economics - Nothing can beat this year in terms of speculating what will happen to economy due to the pandemic. This books clearly catches how humans react to unknown events and  satisfy ourselves with narratives that fit our understanding.

2. The Psychology of Money - I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Enough said, I will let this book do the talking.

3. Fooled by Randomness - N N Taleb is the guy you listen to especially in a year which has seen a black swan event.  He is to the point and slaps you in the face with his amazing, out of this world understanding of Randomness. No bullshit tolerated. 

4. Flashboys - I will read everything coming from Michael Lewis. I am a huge Fan.

5. A gentlemen in moscow, The Spy and the Traitor, Hhhh and The book thief - To me all these books can be summarized by few lines.
“Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.”
As a second order effect of this cycle we get so many inspiring stories of people doing impossible. These are some of the best.
